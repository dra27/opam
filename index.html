  <h1>Branch information</h1>
  <p><b>camlp5-detection</b> contains the script mentioned in
     <a href="http://www.dra27.uk/blog/platform/2018/05/04/opam-camlp5-system.html">this blog
     post</a>, following problems with camlp5 7.03.</p>
  <p><b>crlf-hashing</b> &amp; <b>crlf-hashing-2</b> originally merged in
     <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/3407">#3407</a> and proposed in
     <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/3414">#3414</a>. The original PR was reverted.
     Both branches left until CRLF hashing is properly resolved.</p>
  <p><b>crlf-preservation-work</b> is a WIP related to the
     <a href="https://github.com/dra27/opam-file-format/tree/crlf-preserving">crlf-preserving</a>
     branch in opam-file-format.</p>
  <p><b>filter-string-vars</b> prototype allowing variables in the string expansion ternary
     operator (<code>%{var?true:false}%</code>). Incomplete; head commit only; more details
     in commit message.</p>
  <p><b>opam-admin.top-console</b> is a single commit (on top of another fix) dealing with console
     slowness on Windows when using opam-admin.top on a large repo.</p>
  <p><b>opam-admin.top-printers</b> is a small leftover from debugging something else where
        opam-admin.top needed to display values better. Could be expanded to include all types
        and actually load them by default (using toplevellib)?. Head commit only.</p>
  <p><b>switch-globals</b> - further work extending <b>switch-defaults</b>. Parked for now, since
     adding <code>--set</code> to <code>opam install</code> seems to have more potential.</p>
  <p><b>travis-windows</b> was an experiment trying out Travis's Windows support.</p>
  <p><b>win-zips</b> is the <code>make win-zips</code> work, permitting multiple compilers to be
     compiled in <code>bootstrap</code>.</p>
  <p><b>windows-checkpoint</b> June 2015 snapshot of a very early port of opam 1.2</p>
  <p><b>windows-1.3</b> May 2016 snapshot of last working version opam 1.3 (before rebasing to
     opam 2.0).</p>
  <h1>OPAM on Native Windows</h1>
  <h2>Version <code>af03a14</code></h2>
  <p><a href="SHA512SUMS">SHA512SUMS</a> for all four zip files.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mingw: <a href="opam-af03a14-mingw.zip">opam-af03a14-mingw.zip</a></li>
    <li>mingw64: <a href="opam-af03a14-mingw64.zip">opam-af03a14-mingw64.zip</a></li>
    <li>msvc: <a href="opam-af03a14-msvc.zip">opam-af03a14-msvc.zip</a></li>
    <li>msvc64: <a href="opam-af03a14-msvc64.zip">opam-af03a14-msvc64.zip</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each zip contains OPAM compiled with a different flavour of OCaml 4.02.3. The choice of which
  zip to use does not affect the switches available: on 64-bit Windows, all four versions of OPAM
  can maintain 32- and 64-bit switches. Obviously, to run either a 64-bit build of OPAM or install a
  64-bit switch, you must actually be using 64-bit Windows&hellip;</p>
